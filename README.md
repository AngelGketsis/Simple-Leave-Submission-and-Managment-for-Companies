A very simplistic system for a hypothetical employees to submit leave requests and for managers to either accept them or decline them.

It offers the ability to add users either employees or managers, for employess to log in and either submit leave requests or see their past requests and for managers to see requests pending by employees they manage.

The original version was made using a lot of basic HTML and PHP using a usb server to emulate the server side of the project.

A newer version of the project could be enhanced with CSS and Javascript.
